#### Introduction 

Programmatic trading involves many time and detail-intensive tasks, making developing and implementation of strategy more difficult for traders at Xaxis. We know because you have told us!

Copilot Satellite has been built to help with this—to make programmatic media trading at Xaxis less tedious and more strategic for Copilot users.

As a web browser extension that can access Copilot and DSP information in real-time, Copilot Satellite is in a unique position to assist with many of the repetitive and detail-intensive trader activities that are executed across one or multiple web-based platforms simultaneously. 


#### Why does Copilot Satellite collect data?

In order to enable the Copilot Links functionality, Copilot Satellite must gather your Copilot User ID to be able to identify your specific DSP line items and their attached Copilot Strategies and create hyperlinks.

To provide useful, time-saving features for repetitive tasks in general, Copilot Satellite must have a means of “knowing” what activities you are trying to do. For this reason, Copilot Satellite collects data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;	to understand what activities within which DSPs time is being spent, for the identification and prioritization of the most useful features, and 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;	to provide automatic, user-facing recommendations based on Xaxis best-practices, and other time-saving measures. 


#### What data does Copilot Satellite *not* collect? 

We do not collect information from any personal online browsing. Social media usage, personal email, bank transactions, online shopping; we collect none of this. That is all your business and we believe that you should always enjoy privacy, free from company oversite, while conducting your business. 

In short: Copilot Satellite does not collect any information from you that you would not want it to. It only collects information it needs to make tedious trader tasks easier. That’s it!
